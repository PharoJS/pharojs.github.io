    </div>
<h2>General Questions</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li><a name="install">How do I install PharoJS?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Install can be done inside a <a title="Download Pharo" href="https://pharo.org/download/">Pharo 7 image</a> by evaluating the following in a playground:
    <pre>
Metacello new 
    baseline: 'PharoJS';
    repository: 'github://bouraqadi/PharoJS';
    load
    </pre>
</p>
    <p>
    Upon install, Pharo will download HTML code for examples.
    They are located in a folder along with the image and the change files. This is: 
	<code>pharo-local/iceberg/bouraqadi/PharoJS/HTML</code> It contains subfolders for each example and test.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="help">Where can I get help with PharoJS?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    The best place is with the <a href="https://pharojs.slack.com">PharoJS Slack workspace</a>.
    To get an account there, either send a twitter direct-message to <a href="https://twitter.com/pharojs">@pharojs</a> or an email to <a href="email:pharojs@scs.ryerson.ca">pharojs@scs.ryerson.ca</a>.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>Where can I find the PharoJS documentation?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    The PharoJS documentation is <a href="doc.html">available at this linked page</a>.
    It includes (but not restricted to) conference papers and slides of talks presenting different facets of PharoJS.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>Does PharoJS work with Pharo6 or earlier?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    Pharo6 had some stability issues, so we elected to skip Pharo 6.
    PharoJS is available on Pharo 7.
    It also ran on Pharo 5, but all new development is in Pharo 7.
  </div>
  </li>

  <!-- <li><a>Is there a PharoJS pre-builtImage?</a>
  <div class="answer">
  </div>
  </li> -->

  <li><a>Where can I find the HTML code for App tests (e.g. PjCounterApp and PjMinimalApp)?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    Upon PharoJS install, the HTML code for app tests are located in a folder along with the image and the change files. This is: 
	<code>pharo-local/iceberg/bouraqadi/PharoJS/HTML</code> It contains subfolders for each example and test.

You can be found it also in the PharoJS Git repository, along with Pharo code: <a href="https://github.com/bouraqadi/PharoJS">https://github.com/bouraqadi/PharoJS</a>.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="mobile">Does PharoJS support developing mobile apps with Cordova/PhoneGap?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    Yes. There is a dedicated page that explains <a href="mobileAppDev.html">how to use PharoJS to make mobile apps for Android and iOS</a>.
  </div>
  </li>


  <li><a name="seaside">Does PharoJS Integrates with Seaside?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>We have an experimental feature. It shows the feasibility of the idea, but the solution is not clean. That is, if you have multiple Seaside components with PharoJS code, you'll end up with redundant JS code. The component will work, but it will waste resources (network bandwidth). This at least 65KB per component.</p>
		<p>PharoJS integration with Seaside is defined in a dedicated pacakge <code>PharoJsSeaside</code>. You'll finde below instructions on how to install it.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Latest version for Pharo 7 and above (GitHub): Evaluate the following code in playground.
			<pre>
Metacello new
	baseline: 'PharoJsSeaside';
	repository: 'github://bouraqadi/PharoJS';
	load
			</pre>
		</li>
	<li>Old version for Pharo 5 (SmalltalkHub): Evalate the following in a playground:
<pre>
Gofer it
	smalltalkhubUser: 'noury' project: 'PharoJS';
	configurationOf: #PharoJsSeaside;
	loadBleedingEdge.
</pre>
	</li>
	</ul>

<p>The code is pretty straight forward. To test it, start Seaside and open 
<code>http://localhost:8080/PharoJS/</code>.</p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>Where can I download the ESUG 2016 Demo (Pharo 4 image + Web App + PhoneGap App)?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    A ready to use Pharo 4 image with the demo from <a href="doc.html#esug2016Talk">the ESUG 2016 talk</a>. The zip file  includes the files (e.g. HTML) for the web app and for the PhoneGap mobile application [<a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B7fN7OYplsLmcG9Cb3pDcWVYS00&export=download" target="_blank">ZIP approx. 85 MB</a>]
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>Where can I find a video explanation of PharoJS with examples?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWd2mCQPZUU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <div class="answer">

  <li><a>How do I contribute to PharoJS?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      Since PharoJS is on GitHub, essentially what you do is make a fork of PharoJS, load your fork with Iceberg, make and commit your changes, and then create a pull request. Then Noury or Dave will load your pull request, test it, and put it into the PharoJS repository.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>You must have a Github account, let's say: <code>YourName</code></li>
      <li>On GitHub, clone <a href="https://github.com/bouraqadi/PharoJS">PharoJS</a></li>
      <li>Then, in a fresh image you evaluate the following
<pre>Metacello new
    baseline: 'PharoJS';
    repository: 'github://YourName/PharoJS';
    load</pre></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/bouraqadi/pharojs/issues">Create an issue</a> if there isn't one already</li>
      <li>Create a branch in Iceberg called <code>issue</code><em>nn</em> with the issue number from above</li>
      <li>Apply your changes in that branch, commit locally, and push them to your clone on GitHub</li>
      <li>In your browser go to <a href="https://github.com/bouraqadi/PharoJS">PharoJS on github</a> and  click on "new pull request" button. In the drop down, select your pull request + branch</li>
      <li>Wait for your contribution to be incorporated. Thanks!!!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </li>

<h2>PharoJS code questions</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li><a>How can I create a <code>KeyboardEvent</code> or <code>MouseEvent</code>?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <pre>
    window KeyboardEvent new: #keypress with: { #key -> #Enter. #keyCode -> 13. #which -> 13 } asDictionary
    window MouseEvent new: #click
    </pre>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>How can I create a DOM object?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <pre>
	rectangle := document createElement: 'div'.
	rectangle id: 'grn'.
	document body appendChild: rectangle.
    </pre>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>How do I reference a field in a native Javascript object? Call a method?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    In most cases, simply treating it as a message send works:
    <pre>
	jsobj fieldName.             " equivalent to jsobj.fieldName "
	jsobj fieldName: 0.          " equivalent to jsobj.fieldName=0 "
    </pre>
    You do exactly the same to call a method:
    <pre>
	jsobj methodName.            " equivalent to jsobj.methodName() "
	jsobj methodName: 0.         " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0) "
	jsobj methodName: 0 foo: 42. " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0,42) "
	jsobj methodName: 0 bar: 42. " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0,42) "
    </pre>
    Notice that the message name for multiple parameters is only matched to the first parameter, so the last 2 examples are functionally identical.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the field is a method (function) then simply referencing it will call it, so to get or change the value you must use:
    <pre>
	jsobj instVarNamed:#count.
	jsobj instVarNamed:#count put: 0.
    </pre>
    You can also use this to force creation of a slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a minor detail about Javascript "classes" such as <code>MouseEvent</code> because they are implemented as special Javascript functions, but usually you don't want to call them, you want to send them a <code>new</code> message.
      So if the message name starts with an uppercase letter, it is treated as a value reference, rather than as a function.
      This allows the following to work:
      <pre>
    window MouseEvent new: #click
      </pre>
      </p>
  </div>
  </li>
  
  <li><a>Why can't PharoJS do ...?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    The premise of PharoJS is that you can develop code in the Pharo IDE with the GUI in the browser, including running tests.
    Then when you're finished, you can export the whole thing to Javascript and have it execute the same way (or similar, see the <a href="#differences">question about differences</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    To achieve this, we communicate across a bridge between the running Pharo image and the running browser (see the <a href="#bridge">question about the bridge</a>).
    This means that there are limitations in how processing on the browser side can proceed.
    Most paticularly, you can't call-back a block (and wait for the return value) from within code running on the browser.
    The closest you can do is call a block, and pass it a continuation block as a parameter.
    It could then run on the Pharo side, and call the browser block passing the result.
    </p>
    <p>
    We control the transpilation to Javascript, but we have no control over the Pharo Smalltalk compilation, so we can't add any fundamentally new concept.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="bridge">How does the bridge work? What are proxies?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    The bridge is used during development to connect the running Pharo image and the running PharoJS code in the browser - but does not exist in production code.
    The bridge is implemented over a WebSocket which allows bi-directional asynchronous communication.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are proxy objects on the Pharo side that represent objects on the browser.
    Some of there are global proxies, such as <code>document</code>, <code>window</code>, etc. which are implemented as Javascript globals (see the <a href="#globals">question on globals</a>).
    When you send a message to a proxy, a DNU intervenes and sends the parameters across the bridge to the browser, which calls the method on the object referred to by the proxy, and returns the result.
    <ul>
      <li>
      If that result is a simple value (number, boolean, string, nil) it is returned across the bridge to the Pharo side which has suspended your code, awaiting the response.
      The response is converted to a Smalltalk value, and returned to your code.
      </li>
      <li>
      If that result is not a simple value, a reference to that value is created (so it doesn't get garbage collected by the browser), and a reference is passed back across the bridge.
      That reference is converted to a proxy, and that proxy is returned to your code.
      </li>
      <li>
      When all references to that proxy have disappeared on the Pharo side, the browser side is told to remove the holding reference.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The other main thing that comes across the bridge are callbacks.
      A callback is a reflection of an event occuring on the broswer.
      The structure for callbacks is created by sending an <code>addEventListener:block:</code> message to a proxy (see the <a href="#addEventListener">question on this</a>).
      In order to faithfully emulate the Javascript execution model, no callback can happen while an existing callback is executing, or while any initial interactionwith the  browser is taking place.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="addEventListener">Why do I need to use <code>addEventListener:block:</code> to set event handlers?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    The structure for callbacks is created by sending an <code>addEventListener:block:</code> message to a proxy (typically of a DOM object).
    The referenced Smalltalk block must be held as long as there are references to it on the browser.
    Unfortunately, there isn't currently a weak data-structure available in browsers that would allow us reliably to clean these up.
    So we resort to using reference counting, so you also need to use <code>addEventListener:block:</code> with a <code>nil</code> block to remove the callback.
    Not explicitly removing a callback can lead to memory being tied up on the Pharo side until the bridge is closed, but seems like a reasonable trade-off as it only applies during development.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="differences">What are the differences between normal Smalltalk and PharoJS Smalltalk?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    We try very hard to make the translation from Smalltalk to Javascript seamless, but there are some differences that are either impossible to handle, or would be hugely inefficient:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric stack: in Javascript all numbers are IEEE <code>double</code>s, so there are no big-ints, or fractions.</li>
      <li><code>thisContext</code> does not exist, so any method that references it will be uncompilable.</li>
      <li><code>become:</code> is unsupported.</li>
      <li>Primitives are not supported.</li>
      <li>There are no processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="importMethods">How do I reference methods from Pharo classes (like <code>Number class&gt;&gt;#primesUpTo:</code>?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    Unfortunately, “<em>automatically importing methods from Pharo classes for classes we have duplicated (like <code>Number</code>) or other classes without importing the whole class</em>” is on our todo list.
    In the meantime, add the following to <code>PjNumber</code> class-side:
    <pre>jsTranspilationImportMethodsNonstandard
	&lt;pharoJsSkip&gt;
	^ {
		Number class -> #(primesUpTo: primesUpTo:do:).
           }</pre>
    This says to import those 2 methods from the <code>Number</code> class.
    This is the user definable version of <code>jsTranspilationImportMethods</code> (for which <code>PjNumber</code> has quite a large implementation) which allows you to augment the list of methods that it imports.
    You should put this method in <code>PjNumber class</code> with a category of <code>*YourPackage</code> so that it will be associated with your package by Monticello or Iceberg.
    <p>
      We can't import all of e.g. <code>Number</code> or <code>Object</code>, because it would cause considerable code bloat in your application, and because there are methods in some of those classes that cannot be compiled (see the <a href="#differences">question on differences</a>).
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a>Can I generate code for NodeJS? Can I use Node modules?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    Yes, you certainly can use Node.
    Many people would question the decision as they would prefer to provide the application in Pharo directly, with all the advantages that entails.
    However, there are situations where deploying as Node is preferred (such as creating an Electron application - before you ask: we don't have that quite figured out yet, but we'd help someone who wants to).
    </p>
    <p>
    Subclass <code>PjNodeApplication</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    To access modules, define a polyfill similar to <code>PjWebSocketPolyfill</code> (see the <a href="#polyfill">question on polyfills</a>).
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="polyfill">What are polyfills?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)">A polyfill</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)"> a code shim</a> that implements a feature on Javascript engines that do not otherwise support the feature.
    In PharoJS, polyfills add code at the beginning of the generated Javascript that does whatever is necessary to make a global value/class available in the Javascript engine.
    As such, a polyfill is a Javascript global (see the <a href="#globals">question on globals</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    To define a polyfill, a subclass of <code>PjJavascriptGlobals</code> must define one or more of <code>browserPolyfill:</code>, <code>domPolyfill:</code>, or <code>nodePolyfill:</code> to output the necessary Javascript to set up the polyfill.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="globals">How do I access Javascript global values?</a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    PharoJS uses the Pharo Smalltalk pool dictionary facility to make Javascript globals available to code running in the Pharo image.
    In particular groups of such symbols are defined in subclasses of <code>PjJavascriptGlobals</code> and initialized with proxy values (see the <a href="#bridge">question on the bridge</a>) so they can be accessed.
    The appropriate globals are automatically available to subclasses of <code>PjApplication</code>.
    If you need them in a class that doesn't subclass that, add a <code>poolDictionaries:</code> parameter to your <code>subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:package:</code> (see <code>PjBrowserApplication</code> for an example).
    </p>
    <p>
    It you create your own globals, you should use the trait <code>PjTJavascriptGlobalsInitializer</code> which defines a class <code>initialize</code> method so that a proxy is available.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Dealing with errors</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li><a>PharoJS tests and playground raise on Safari error: <code>SecurityError (DOM Exception 18): The operation is insecure</code></a>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>This error prevents running PharoJS tests with Safari as a default browser. This problem also arises when opening a PharoJS playground on a app (e.g. `PjCounterBrowserApp`).</p>
    
    <p>The cause of the bug is that currently, we open HTML files from the disk. This works fine with Firefox and Chrome. But, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24997292/localstorage-access-from-local-file">Safari's new security system forbids accessing JS global `localStorage` when the HTML or the JS code is loaded from <code>file://</code></a></p>
    
    <p>Luckily, there is a workaround. First, ensure you have the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">Safari developer tools installed</a>. Then, in the `Develop` menu check the "Disable local file restrictions"  item.</p>
    
    <p>This is needed only during development. Once your app is ready for production, you export the code and make it available on a server. You should not experience the issue.</p>
    
    <p>Don't forget that PharoJS allows building HTML apps. Thus, if you require accessing sensitive resources, you are likely to have to define a <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">content security policy</a> in your HTML file using the <code>meta</code> tag. You can find some examples in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30280370/how-does-content-security-policy-work">the Stack overflow response addressing this question</a></p>
