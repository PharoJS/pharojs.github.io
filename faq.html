<h2>General Questions</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li>Where can I get help with PharoJS?
  <div class="answer">
    The best place is with the <a href="https://pharojs.slack.com">PharoJS Slack workspace</a>.
    To get an account there, either send a twitter direct-message to <a href="https://twitter.com/pharojs">@pharojs</a> or an email to <a href="email:pharojs@scs.ryerson.ca">pharojs@scs.ryerson.ca</a>.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li>Where can I find the PharoJS documentation?
  <div class="answer">
    The PharoJS documentation is <a href="doc.html">available at this linked page</a>.
    It includes (but not restricted to) conference papers and slides of talks presenting different facets of PharoJS.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li>How do I install PharoJS?
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Install can be done inside a <a title="Download Pharo" href="http://pharo.org/download" target="_blank">Pharo 5 image</a> by evaluating the following in a playground:
    <pre>
    Gofer it
    smalltalkhubUser: 'noury' project: 'PharoJS';
    configurationOf: #PharoJS ;
    loadBleedingEdge.
    </pre>

    This will install the most recent public version.
    To install the latest stable version, please use <code>loadStable</code> instead of <code>loadBleedingEdge</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upon install, Pharo will download HTML code for examples.
    The are located in the <code>PharoJS-master</code> foloder along with the image and the change file. It contains subfolders for each example and test.
    </p>
    <p>
    After installation you should run all of the PharoJS test to verify that your setup is working correctly.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li>Does PharoJS work with Pharo6?
  <div class="answer">
    Pharo6 had some stability issues, so we elected to skip Pharo 6.
    PharoJS will be available on Pharo 7 shortly after it is available.
  </div>

<h2>PharoJS code questions</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li>How can I create a <code>KeyboardEvent</code> or <code>MouseEvent</code>?
  <div class="answer">
    <pre>
    window KeyboardEvent new: #keypress with: { #key -> #Enter. #keyCode -> 13. #which -> 13 } asDictionary
    window MouseEvent new: #click
    </pre>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li>How can I create a DOM object?
  <div class="answer">
    <pre>
	rectangle := document createElement: 'div'.
	rectangle id: 'grn'.
	document body appendChild: rectangle.
    </pre>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li>How do I reference a field in a native Javascript object? Call a method?
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    In most cases, simply treating it as a message send works.
    <pre>
	jsobj fieldName.             " equivalent to jsobj.fieldName "
	jsobj fileName: 0.           " equivalent to jsobj.fieldName=0 "
    </pre>
    You do exactly the same to send a message
    <pre>
	jsobj methodName.            " equivalent to jsobj.methodName() "
	jsobj methodName: 0.         " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0) "
	jsobj methodName: 0 foo: 42. " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0,42) "
	jsobj methodName: 0 bar: 42. " equivalent to jsobj.methodName(0,42) "
    </pre>
    Notice that the message name for multiple parameters is only matched to the first parameter, so the last 2 examples are functionally identical.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the field is a method (function) then simply referencing it will call it, so you must use:
    <pre>
	jsobj instVarNamed:#count.
	jsobj instVarNamed:#count put: 0.
    </pre>
    You can also use this to force creation of a slot.
    </p>

  </li>
  
  <li>Why can't PharoJS do ...?
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    The premise of PharoJS is that you can develop code in the Pharo IDE with the GUI in the browser, including running tests.
    Then when you're finished, you can export the whole thing to Javascript and have it execute the same way (or similar, see the <a href="#differences">question about differences</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    To achieve this, we communicate across a bridge between the running Pharo image and the running browser (see the <a href="#bridge">question about the bridge</a>).
    This means that there are limitations in how processing on the browser side can proceed.
    Most paticularly, you can't call-back a block (and wait for the return value) from within code running on the browser.
    The closest you can do is call a block, and pass it a continuation block as a parameter.
    It could then run on the Pharo side, and call the browser block passing the result.
    </p>
    <p>
    We control the transpilation to Javascript, but we have no control over the Pharo Smalltalk compilation, so we can't add any fundamentally new concept.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="bridge">How</a> does the bridge work?
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    The bridge is used during development to connect the running Pharo image and the running PharoJS code in the browser - but does not exist in production code.
    The bridge is implemented over a WebSocket which allows bi-directional asynchronous communication.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are proxy objects on the Pharo side that represent objects on the browser.
    Some of there are global proxies, such as <code>document</code>, <code>window</code>, etc.
    When you send a message to a proxy, a DNU intervenes and sends the parameters across the bridge to the browser, which calls the method on the object referred to by the proxy, and returns the result.
    <ul>
      <li>
      If that result is a simple value (number, boolean, string, nil) it is returned across the bridge to the Pharo side which has suspended your code, awaiting the response.
      The response is converted to a Smalltalk value, and returned to your code.
      </li>
      <li>
      If that result is not a simple value, a reference to that value is created (so it doesn't get garbage collected by the browser), and a reference is passed back across the bridge.
      That reference is converted to a proxy, and that proxy is returned to your code.
      </li>
      <li>
      When all references to that proxy have disappeared on the Pharo side, the browser side is told to remove the holding reference.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    The other main thing that comes across the bridge are callbacks.
    A callback is a reflection of an event occuring on the broswer.
    The structure for callbacks is created by sending an <code>addEventListener:block:</code> message to a proxy (see the <a name="addEventListener">question on this</a>).
    In order to faithfully emulate the Javascript execution model, no callback can happen while an existing callback is executing, or while any initial interaction browser is taking place.
    </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="addEventListener">Why</a> do I need to use <code>addEventListener:block:</code> to set event handlers?
  <div class="answer">
    The structure for callbacks is created by sending an <code>addEventListener:block:</code> message to a proxy (typically of a DOM object).
    The referenced Smalltalk block must be held as long as there are references to it on the browser.
    Unfortunately, there isn't currently a weak data-structure available in browsers that would allow us reliably to clean these up.
    So we resort to using reference counting, so you also need it use <code>addEventListener:block:</code> with a <code>nil</code> block to remove the callback.
    This can lead to a memory leak, but since it only applies to development and debugging and doesn't affect production, this seems like a reasonable trade-off.
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a name="differences">What</a> are the differences between normal Smalltalk and PharoJS Smalltalk?
  <div class="answer">
    We try very hard to make the translation from Smalltalk to Javascript seamless, but there are some differences that are either impossible to handle, or would be hugely inefficient:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric stack: in Javascript all numbers are IEEE <code>double</code>s, so there are no big-ints, or fractions.</li>
      <li><code>thisContext</code> does not exist, so any method that references it will be uncompilable.</li>
      <li><code>become:</code> is unsupported.</li>
      <li>Primitives are not supported.</li>
      <li>There are no processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Dealing with errors</h2>
<ul class="openClose">
  <li>PharoJS tests and playground raise on Safari error: <code>SecurityError (DOM Exception 18): The operation is insecure</code>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>This error prevents running PharoJS tests with Safari as a default browser. This problem also arises when opening a PharoJS playground on a app (e.g. `PjCounterBrowserApp`).</p>
    
    <p>The cause of the bug is that currently, we open HTML files from the disk. This works fine with Firefox and Chrome. But, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24997292/localstorage-access-from-local-file">Safari's new security system forbids accessing JS global `localStorage` when the HTML or the JS code is loaded from <code>file://</code></a></p>
    
    <p>Luckily, there is a workaround. First, ensure you have the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">Safari developer tools installed</a>. Then, in the `Develop` menu check the "Disable local file restrictions"  item.</p>
    
    <p>This is needed only during development. Once your app is ready for production, you export the code and make available on a server. You should not experience the issue.</p>
    
    <p>Don't forget that PharoJS allows building HTML apps. Thus, if you require accessing sensitive resources, you are likely to have to define a <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">content security policy</a> in your HTML file using the <code>meta</code> tag. You can find some examples in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30280370/how-does-content-security-policy-work">the Stack overflow response addressing this question</a></p>
